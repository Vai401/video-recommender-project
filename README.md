# Video Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a **Video Recommendation System** using TensorFlow Recommenders. The model utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend videos to users based on their interactions with previously watched videos. The project includes a sample dataset, model training, and implementation of an API for real-time recommendations.

## Features

- **User and Video Embeddings**: Utilizes TensorFlow Keras layers for creating user and video embeddings.
- **Trainable Recommendation Model**: Works with binary interaction data to train a recommendation model for personalized suggestions.
- **API Integration**: Features a Flask-based API for real-time video recommendations.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to fetch recommendations for a user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Git**
- **TensorFlow**
- **TensorFlow Recommenders**
- **Flask**
- **Pandas**

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

pip install tensorflow tensorflow-recommenders Flask pandas

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Retrieve the project files from the repository.
2. **Install Required Packages**: Use the above `pip` command to install necessary libraries.
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook where the implementation is located and run the cells to execute the model.

## Example Usage

Instructions for how to fetch recommendations for a user can be found within the Jupyter Notebook documentation or directly in the code comments.
